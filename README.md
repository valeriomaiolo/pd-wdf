Towards Virtual Analog modeling through Wave Digital Filters in Pure Data.

Here, a simple example of an RC low-pass filter in which a 3X3 scattering matrix is involved. 

Parameters, such as capacitance and resistance, are available to be changed in real-time.

'RClpf.pd' is the main file.

'RCfilter.asc' is the circuit simulation in LTSpice.

The Matlab file compares the Matlab implementation with the one made in Pure Data.
